TestApp5
========

I basically only worked with the tutorial on developer.android.com and got as far as finishing the first lesson: adding a text field, making a send button and making a new activity that displays the sent message. I spent most of my time installing Intellij and the android-sdk on my computer and making it work. The emulator wouldn't run until I figured I had to decrease the RAM of my emulator for my Windows. Someone recommended watching videos by thenewboston.org of which I watched about 5 videos. They were actually really helpful-they explained things such as the xml layouts in a nicer way and with more detail.
